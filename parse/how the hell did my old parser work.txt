a + b + c

======
curTok
    description
a 
    expr = lit
    peekMatches == true
+
    right = mult_or_higher()

in mult_or_higher:
    literal matched
    return literal

ergo
    right = lit

======
but what if left/right is expr?

a * b + c / e

curTok
    description

a
    a * b matched as multi
+
    expr = err
    peekMatches == true
b
    right = div


how did I make this algorithm in the first place??? it works somehow
